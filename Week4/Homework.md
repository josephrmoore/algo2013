##Non-Code:
0. Take a video of real world particles.  Here's an example: https://vimeo.com/28732551

NOT DONE (In repo file name: )

##Code:
1. If you didn't finish the John Whitney assignment from last week, just finish that one.

Done last week

2. Instead of writing an email (it's ok if you already did) add to this piratepad if there are topics you'd like to go over more in a class soon.  http://piratepad.net/kPg029KxBx

Done

3. These core ideas translate across any language. Make a version of the line follow creature - in processing (processing.org)  The processing docs are quite good as well http://processing.org/reference/.

Done (OF->Processing - Processing folder is in there)

4. create a looping fireworks animation (non interactive). You will need to reset or restart particles every so often.  Take a look at the last code example from class today (NoiceParticles) to see how to delete from a vector safely!

Done (Fireworks)
