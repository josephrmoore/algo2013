Homework

Non-code:

Make a flip book.  Try to use a sketchbook that has slightly thicker paper, it should feel satisfying to flip through!

Code:

Create a github account of you don't have one already and create a repo for the class that you'll use to submit your homework.  Name it as follows, lastname_algo2013 and then add my github as a collaborator (cwhitney).  To do so, go to your repo, click "Settings" on the right-hand side, and then click collaborators on the right.

a) fastest non moving speed

Find the fastest speed for the square to move across the screen and have the motion be imperceptible. Time how long it takes for the square to move across the screen and measure the physical (not pixel) distance. What is this speed in inches/second ? for kicks, What is it in in mph?

b) fastest still perceptible speed

find the fastest speed for the square to move across the screen and have the motion be still perceived as continuous (not discrete jumps). Time how long it takes for the square to move across the screen and measure the physical (not pixel) distance. What is this speed in inches/second ? What is this rate in mph?

c) click to change Point A and Point B

make an application where whenever you click, you change either the point A position or the point B position to the mouse position, alternating every time you click.

d) shaper controlls something else besides position

Make the shape code control another property of the object, such as its size or color. Make the nicest composition that you can. Try to make it elegant and organic.

(for the xeno code)

e) multiple xenos

make a series of xeno objects which follow the mouse, each at different rates. give them slightly different colors so that you can perceive them as independent objects. you will have to modify the rectangle object so that they can have unique colors.

Bonus homework - 
This is advanced, but take a shot!

f) multiple xenos trail

If you are really feeling like showing off, make an array of xeno objects where the first element follows the mouse, the second element follows the first, the third follows the second, etc.
