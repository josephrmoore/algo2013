##Non-Code:

##Code:
1. Do your own take on the win screen of Windows Solitaire using what we learned today about forces. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qE46ANisnjY  It doesn't have to be exactly the same.  As always play around until you get something unique that you like!

2. Make a composition using attractors and repulsors.  Make them invisible and use the trails from objects you are pushing around to make something beautiful!  Play around with composition and think about the principles of design.  Consider your use of color and potentially driving it with a sampling an image like we have been doing.

Advanced:

3. Try to make a "strange attractor" in openFrameworks.  It's a fractal structure and you can think of it similarly to the lissajous curves we were making before.  This one is probably a test of your research skills more than anything else!  Here's an example of one written in actionscript http://www.joa-ebert.com/swf/index.php?swf=alchemy/Example03  This one is in 3D, but 2D is great too!
