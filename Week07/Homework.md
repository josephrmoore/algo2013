##Code:
1. Look through your classmates repos and create a piece based on of one of theirs.  In your source, remember to credit the specific github URL where you got it from.  Consider the process they went through to arrive at where they did, and make yours a thoughtful response to it.

2. Look at the VectorField examples in the repo.  In the first example, we're setting the vectors in the field three different ways.  First, in a single direction, second, in a random direction, and third, with perlin noise.  Come up with __two__ more ways to set all of the directions of the vectors.

Advanced:

3. Try to use ofxXmlSettings to save and load vector positions so that they are persistent when you close and reopen the application.
