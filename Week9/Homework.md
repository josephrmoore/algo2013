##Non-Code:
1. Dan Savage introduced the 12 basic principles of animation (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12_basic_principles_of_animation). Scour youtube, and find examples for **SIX** of the twelve.  You should have a text file in your repo with links to the videos and which principle they embody.  We'll look at some in class, so be sure to get it in on time!

##Code:
2. Now that we have them thoroughly researched, make a **looping** composition that specifically embodies a minimum of two of these.  Think of this animation as something you'd want to export and put up on your own vimeo page.

3. Squash and stretch really help things come alive.  Build squash and stretch into one of our particle simulations.  When a particle collides, it should squash, and when it's flying at high speed, it should stretch!  Pay attention to which direction it squashes and stretches.  You may want to make particles bigger so it's easier to see.

Advanced:
4. When we get tired of circles as particles, it's nice to drop in an image.  Take it one step further and make something play back a series of images.  A hint to get you started: the images should all be the same size and from there, it's as easy as only drawing the current frame in the animation.
