Algorithmic Animation Fall 2013 Final
========

During the semester we've focused on moving things on screen through the lens of computation.  For your final, I'd like you to take one or more of the concepts we've learned during class and blow them out into a full scale openFrameworks application. If you like, you can even use a specific homework as a jumping off point.  Along with your application you'll be required to submit a brief written concept explaining how you arrived at your final piece in addition to how it fits into the context of “algorithmic animation”.

We've been working almost exclusively on small screens, but for your final I'd also like you to consider the environment that this project should be viewed in.  For example, it could be a gigantic building projection, or a small mobile project. This should all be a part of your written component.

You are also welcome to leverage technologies and things you've learned from your other classes.  If there are things outside of the realms of what we have covered, they are fair game as well.  We will have two in class working sessions, one on December 3rd, and one on December 10th.  There will also be the same regular office hours as well in case you want to use something we haven’t learned in class.

Finally, instead of doing in class presentations, we’ll have a small get together off campus somewhere where we can relax and bit and celebrate the semester being over and revel in all the cool work everyone has created.  This will likely be on December 13-14.

Finals are due at 6:00PM on December 16th.  No exceptions.
