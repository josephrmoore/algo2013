Homework for 11/17 - Algo

1. Make a composition using animation techniques that is inspired by John Whitney. Think of how he used timing repetition and creating big moments in his works.

- multiple ghost images converging and diverging
- spinning flashing doilies
- mutating sin waves
- concentric shapes going 3d
- flocking chaos
- converging circles
- do spiriograph that bursts into all directions that xeno a random point every second



2. Since we talked a little bit about sound, make a composition based on a piece of music. It doesn't have to be long, but there should be something dynamic to it.  You don't have to have the sound included in the application, but your code should be the visual equivalent to the music.  Think about what the artist was trying to say with the music, and try to bring that out in your visuals.

CHORE

3. Use sin / cos to emulate a natural phenomenon.  Post a picture or video of what your phenomenon is along with you application.


bodyguard breathing


4. Use atan2 in conjunction with some mouse follow code (xeno) or the previous vector/acceleration work and create a creature that follows a point.  Think os using sin/cos to give it living characteristics based on it's motion.  (think of more subtle motions of creatures, breathing, blinking, leg motion, etc)

Optional:
Marc Maron recently did a great interview on jazz and inspiration with musician Ben Sidran.  It's a bit long, but a great conversation about where jazz came from and the grammar that makes up a tune.  Well worth a listen if for no other reason than for some perspective on something that is as much tradition as music. http://www.wtfpod.com/podcast/episodes/episode_420_-_ben_sidran
