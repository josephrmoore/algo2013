##Code:
1. Make a particle application and use some of the techniques we talked about in class, or some of your own devising to make it look like there are many more particles than there actually are.  I'll run the app before looking at the source code, see if you can come up with a novel way!

2. Use our delta time function to step through an application and save out individual frames of your application.  Take a look at ofSaveFrame() and ofSaveScreen().

##Advanced:
3. Implement the 4th unofficial rule of flocking we discussed in class.  A boid is only considered if it's with another boid's field of vision.  Use the ofVec2f angle() function.
